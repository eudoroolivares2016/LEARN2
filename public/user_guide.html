                  <p>Atmospheric rivers are the main phenomena driving extreme rain events in the western United States during the rainy
                season (October-April). Their impacts are near the top of episodic weather events in the West. Accurately forecasting
                rainfall from these events is critical due to the impacts they have on the water supply as well as the severe flooding
                risks they pose. The greatest challenge of mitigating the associated impacts is reducing uncertainty in the medium-range
                forecasts (5-10 days). This is because the most critical decisions are made in this window, from water management in
                reservoir pool reduction to early flood risk communication and preparation. As such, any tool that both reduces
                uncertainty and pushes higher confidence to longer lead times is especially valuable. Forecasters are continually
                looking for insights that might support these critical decisions and another tool in the toolbox could be particularly
                beneficial, especially if, indeed, equivalent forecast skill is pushed out an additional 1 to 2 days.</p>
                
            <p>The Landfalling Event Atmospheric River Neural Network (LEARN2) is a neural-network-based decision support tool that
            considers Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecast guidance from NOAA/National Centers for Environmental Prediction
            (NCEP’s) Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) and the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting Ensembles
            (ECMWF), remotely sensed fields, and several subseasonal-to-seasonal teleconnection indices, to produce extreme rainfall
            predictions. In LEARN2, products are run through both convolutional and fully connected neural networks and a novel
            “voting” algorithm that leverages the power of ensemble forecast systems to predict whether rainfall will exceed
            thresholds of interest at discrete points in a grid for lookaheads of up to 10 days. The structure of each neural
            network is determined for each forecast day via custom genetic algorithms to optimize LEARN2 performance.</p>

            <p>Rainfall prediction is known to be a difficult problem. One difficulty is that it rains far less frequently than it
            doesn’t rain. Though performing a cube root on the rainfall begins to address this problem, it remains the case that the
            dataset is highly unbalanced. Therefore, simple metrics like accuracy of prediction can distort the reported efficacy of
            the system. To evaluate the LEARN2 system more fairly and compare it against state-of-the-art NWP models, we use the
            commonly used F1-score. This score attempts to balance “recall” in which the system can correctly identify all positive
            cases with “precision” in which the system attempts to avoid “false alarms.” The neural networks are tested and trained
            on 20 years of historical data, split randomly into 80% training and 20% testing data. These splits are performed
            multiple times and the F1-score determined on each split to achieve a statistically stable average F1-score for the
            classification behavior of the neural networks.</p>

            <p>LEARN2 is trained on Open Data, including the operational Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFSv12 with 5 ensemble
            members) and ECMWF’s (11 ensemble members) reforecasts spanning 2000-2019, using an Amazon Web Services machine with 48
            CPUs, 196 GB RAM, 50Gb/s network bandwidth, and 4 NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs. LEARN2 is evaluated against the Parameter
            elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) gridded precipitation ground truth dataset. This project's
            results are, in fact, highly promising in delivering additional value in this most critical window. Not surprisingly,
            the development work has been particularly challenging and has required creative and exhaustive
            
            exploration of the associated forecast space including a variety of input models, AI/ML tools, and model configurations.
            Using F1-score as our primary metric, LEARN2’s overall network produces predictions that significantly outperform both
            the GEFS and ECMWF, delivering between one and two additional days of lead time for skillful extreme rainfall prediction
            when validated on fully independent data (see the below figures). Notably, adding the Pacific/North American (PNA),
            Arctic Oscillation (AO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection
            indices introduces additional and complementary forecast-day-dependent predictive skill to the NWP model forecasts.</p>

            <p>Over the next several months, we will be operationally evaluating this tool using near-real-time NWP forecast model
            ensemble members — both NCEP GEFS and ECMWF (the latter via Open Data Creative Commons CC-4.0-BY license and ECMWF Terms
            of Use).</p>

            <p>This project was funded by the NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) under the Small Business Innovative
            Research (SBIR) program.</p>

        <p>The Landfalling Event Atmospheric River Neural Network (LEARN2) forecast tool was developed to provided decision
            makers,
            including operational meteorologists and hydrologists, with high-confidence predictions of extreme precipitation
            events,
            enabling strategic planning and tactical mitigations in advance of landfall. While this tool was developed with
            atmospheric-river events in mind, the training is generalized for the west-coastal-state domain for all
            precipitation
            events, not solely those directly associated with atmospheric rivers.</p>
